Firmware_raw_capture: firmware for laser tape MCU. Program captures data from ADC and send it to UART.

Firmware_phase_calculation: firmware for laser tape MCU.
This program captures data from ADC, calculate phase difference using Goertzel algorithm, send results to UART.

Firmware_dist_calculation_simple:  firmware for laser tape MCU.
This program captures data from ADC, calculate phase difference using Goertzel algorithm, 
calculate distance in mm, send results to UART.
This program uses plain data capture algorithm, so it's not fast.

Firmware_dist_calculation_fast:  firmware for laser tape MCU.
This program captures data from ADC, calculate phase difference using Goertzel algorithm, 
calculate distance in mm, send results to UART.
