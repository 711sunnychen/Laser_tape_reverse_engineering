Steps that I have done:  
- Fully reverse engineered schematic of laser tape.   
- Captured data packets at I2C bus with logic analyzer.  
- Decoded that packets and get values of laser modulation frequencies.  
- Write own firmware for that captures low frequency signal and send it to PC.  
- Write own firmware for that captures signal and processing if using Goertzel algorithm. Phase difference results are send to PC.  
- Main result: Write own firmware ('Firmware_dist_calculation_fast") that calculates distance to object.  
- Write C# PC utilities to process and show pesults.

Main parts of laser tape are STM32F100C8T6 MCU, Si5351 dual PLL, APD (unknown type).  
Laser tape structure schematic:

Loading firmware to laser tape's MCU.  
Connect pins 7 and 8 at keyboard connector (or constantly press "S1" key). That needed to enable laser tape DC-DC converter.  
You need any STM32 programmer that has NRST pin.  
Connect SWCLK, SWDIO, NRST, GND from laser tape to programmer.

Configure programmer to use "Connect under reset".  
Power on laser tape.  
Erase whole STM32 FLASH memory. WARNING: YOU WILL LOSE ORIGINAL LASER TAPE FIRMWARE AT THIS STEP! You are doing it at your own risk!  
Write needed firmware to SM32.  


UART data example ("Firmware_dist_calculation_fast"):  
DIST;01574;AMP;0993;TEMP;1343;VOLT;082\r\n  
DIST - distance to object in mm.  
AMP  - signal amplitude. 
TEMP - APD temperature (raw ADC value).  
VOLT - APD voltage. 
String length is constant.  
UART baudrate - 256000.  

Distance measurement speed - near 60 Hz.  

UART commands ("Firmware_dist_calculation_fast"):  
"E" - enable laser and measurement process.  
"D" - disable laser and measurement process.  
"C" - start zero distance calibration. You need to run zero distance calibration at first start. Place any white object at distance > 10cm from laser tape before calibration.  


To get better results, small board with APD must be closed from external light.
